ClassCastException :-

We can do downcasting of object only when thw child class object us referenced by super class variable.
If we try to make same class object referenced by same class variable and try to do downcating of that object, then we get ClassCastException.

Exanmple :-
Suppose I have two classes :-
i) Animal class
ii) Dog class

Now, Animal is my parent class and Dog is child class. So, to make super class reference with child class object, i need to write :-
       Animal a = new Dog();

Now, I can access all the members parent class, that is, Animal class and overriden methods of Child Class, that is, Dog class, with variable 'a'.
But i want to access Child class variables also, then I need to downcast the object :-
	  Dog d = (Dog)a;

Now, with the help of variable 'd', i can access all methods of Child class, that is, Dog class.

But suppose if i have :-
     Animal a = new Animal();

It is same class reference and same class variable and now if i try to downcast it, then I will get ClassCastException.
